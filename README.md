# Add-Ons For the Homies
## A collection of Firefox add-ons to archive and share content, and help improve users from marginalized backgorunds experience on social media

In my article [About Me: My homies are online and having a bad time](https://rentry.co/techforthehomies_aboutme), I wrote about the failures of social media platforms to cater to users from marginalized backgrounds, and what alternative options we have. I concluded that while many people are fighting to rectify the situation and coming up with independent platforms, these mainstream social media platforms will remain important to us.

Knowing this, I figured a series of tools to help improve our experience on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. are needed. Firefox add-ons seem like an accessible place to start, so I'm working on a few right now.

As of now, I am working on add-ons that:
* Screen for hate speech and provide options for censoring it
* Archive social media content, and provide options sharing via WebTorrent
* Encrypt public content and provide options for selective viewing
